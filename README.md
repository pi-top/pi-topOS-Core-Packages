# pi-topOS Core Packages

This Debian source package builds multiple binary packages that serve to simplify the organisation and structure of packages in pi-topOS.

It is used as a convenient way of installing all of the component parts required for pi-topOS, and smoothly handling changes in packages during system updates.

Note that simple systemd services are managed via the [pi-topOS Core Services](https://github.com/pi-top/pi-topOS-Core-Services) package. More advanced services are provided as part of separate source packages.
