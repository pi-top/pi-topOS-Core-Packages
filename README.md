# pt-os-dummy-packages

This Debian source package builds multiple binary packages that serve to simplify the organisation and structure of packages in pi-topOS.

It is used as a convenient way of installing all of the component parts required for pi-topOS, and smoothly handling changes in packages during system updates.
